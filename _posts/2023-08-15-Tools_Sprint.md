### I love my tools!
The tools I use are: VSCode, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jupyter Notebooks, Slack, and Terminal. I use VSCode to write my code, GitHub to store my code, GitHub Pages to host my blog, Jupyter Notebooks to run my code, Slack to communicate with my team, and terminal so that I can install more tools, run commands, manage my file system and more.

All these tools are essential for me to properly "Code Code Code!" and without them, I wouldn't even be close to the things I can do now. Take VSCode as an example. Without it, I wouldn't be able to comfortably edit this markdown post file right now! Or even a tool like ChatGPT who can help me solve even the hardest of questions. All these tools help to create a better experience for me and help me to code better.
